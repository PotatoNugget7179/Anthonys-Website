        <p id="blog-1">So far, I feel like <em>I am losing my mind.</em> I can't go anywhere or do anything so I have to keep myself busy. That is why I am learning code. It doesn't seem to help much but at least it is productive. It stops me from doom scrolling. I have made myself a friend, and it is comforting to fidget with it. I will post a picture when I can upload it somewhere to the internet. It would be cool if I could get the hang of HTML or CSS and I believe that so long as I keep practicing, I will.</p>

        <p id="blog-2">I watched the Truman show today. This was only because I saw a meme about someone editing Jerma over where Truman should've been. It was the only thing that stopped me from doom scrolling. Then I hopped back onto this website and I got through 2 lessons, ending here with the blog project. This might be fun if I just keep it while im learning code I am wondering If I can finally upload any image into here. I'm going to add random color so that I can satisfy the requirements to this challenge</p>
