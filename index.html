    <h2 id="blog-1">Recap of Before 5/18/2023</h2>


    <p>So far, I feel like <em>I am losing my mind.</em> I can't go anywhere or do anything so I have to keep myself busy. That is why I am learning code. It doesn't seem to help much but at least it is productive. It stops me from doom scrolling. I have made myself a friend, and it is comforting to fidget with it. I will post a picture when I can upload it somewhere to the internet. It would be cool if I could get the hang of HTML or CSS and I believe that so long as I keep practicing, I will.</p>

    <p>I watched the Truman show today. This was only because I saw a meme about someone editing Jerma over where Truman should've been. It was the only thing that stopped me from doom scrolling. Then I hopped back onto this website and I got through 2 lessons, ending here with the blog project. This might be fun if I just keep it while im learning code I am wondering If I can finally upload any image into here. I'm going to add random color so that I can satisfy the requirements to this challenge. "This" referring to when I was keeping this on khan academy. As of 9:09pm today I am changing this background to an obnoxious pink color because I think I'll enter psychosis staring at a white background. You're welcome</p>

    <h1> The Fun part</h1>
    <p>I have just had this website hosted to my domain. I may continue to update the blog and change stylings and stuff like that. But, I may also just screw around with this page because <strong class="bigger"><em>why not?</em></strong>

    <p>I will fill this with some kind of weird fanfiction but I'll need to cook a little longer</p>
