<h1>The Second Page</h1>

<p id="about"> I am starting to get a little better at this (5/19) and I wanted to make a page where I can test out some other properties like text and image formatting. For this I'm going to try to get multiple images on the same x coordinate on the page. I'll probably add more links too. I think this page will have warhammer on it but we'll see. It will be apparent to you, the reader if I do. I think I'll allign this text to the center and make just this paragraph a less obnoxious, but still readable highlight. Like gray or something.</p>

<h4>Ultramarines</h4>

<p id="ultramarines"><image src="https://i.imgur.com/G0HcOaI.jpg" alt="a chunk of my current ultramarine army" id="marine-pic">Space Marines were among my first models. I started by 3d printing Intercessors and then by buying a Tactical Marines squad. That was my first experience building models like this.I soon realized that It would be difficult to learn the game without another army. So I decided that I would go ahead and pick up the recruit edition box for 9th edition which gave me access to Assault Intercessors for melee, and A Primaris Lieutenant, my first HQ model. My current army is around 2000 points or more and probably worth a couple hundred dollars. If my parents every ask though, I paid no more than 100 dollars for <strong><em> all of it.</em></strong><br><br>The reason I enjoy playing them is because they are among the most versatile and the most supported (being the posterboys for the universe). You can build melee armies, shooting focuses, and if you felt like it , you could do a Gray Knights army and use magic. Not only that, but they are detailed models that are fun to paint, yet not too challenging or intimidating for someone stepping into the scene. I think If I hadn't started painting with my Resin Printed Space Marines, I wouldn't enjoy painting as much as I do. On the picture, I know I have a lot of gray still, but I'm working on it. It will get done. Eventually.</p>
