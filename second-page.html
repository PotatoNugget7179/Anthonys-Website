<h1>The Second Page</h1>

<p id="about"> I am starting to get a little better at this (5/19) and I wanted to make a page where I can test out some other properties like text and image formatting. For this I'm going to try to get multiple images on the same x coordinate on the page. I'll probably add more links too. I think this page will have warhammer on it but we'll see. It will be apparent to you, the reader if I do. I think I'll allign this text to the center and make just this paragraph a less obnoxious, but still readable highlight. Like gray or something.</p>

<h4>Ultramarines</h4>
<div class="army-body">
<p id="ultramarines"><image src="https://i.imgur.com/G0HcOaI.jpg" alt="a chunk of my current ultramarine army" class="armies-pic"><span class="army-name">Space Marines</span> were among my first models. I started by 3d printing <em>Intercessors</em> and then by buying a <em>Tactical Marines squad</em>. That was my first experience building models like this.I soon realized that It would be difficult to learn the game without another army. So I decided that I would go ahead and pick up the recruit edition box for 9th edition which gave me access to Assault Intercessors for melee, and A <em>Primaris Lieutenant</em>, my first HQ model. My current army is around 2000 points or more and probably worth a couple hundred dollars. If my parents ever ask though, I paid no more than 100 dollars for <strong><em> all of it.</em></strong><br><br>The reason I enjoy playing them is because they are among the most versatile and the most supported (being the posterboys for the universe). You can build melee armies, shooting focuses, and if you felt like it , you could do a <strong><em>Gray Knights</em></strong> army and use magic. Not only that, but they are detailed models that are fun to paint, yet not too challenging or intimidating for someone stepping into the scene. I think If I hadn't started painting with my Resin Printed Space Marines, I wouldn't enjoy painting as much as I do. On the picture, I know I have a lot of gray still, but I'm working on it. It will get done. Eventually.</p>

<h4>Necrons</h4>
<div class="army-body">
<p id="necrons"><image src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/986482595925741598/1015384187873804338/IMG_8995.jpg" class="armies-pic" alt="My Battlescourge Legion"><span class="army-name">The Necron Legion</span> were my second army to be built in significant number. Before I started printing  Warhammer models myself, I thought Necron lore was super cool. A bunch of undying robots that shot weapons that melted flesh. Their war with the Gods and being successful. Being the strongest xenos in the galaxy, so much so that they had to destroy all of their ancient weapons in fear that they would rip the universe apart. I have a solid number of infantry, with all my <em>Necron warriors</em>, and a solid heavy support line with 2 <em>Canoptek Doomstalkers</em>. I might have about 2000 points of Necrons but I'm not sure. <br><br> Unlike my Space Marine army, they are way better at shooting as opposed to sorcery or melee. Not to say they couldn't hold up  in a brawl. Their <em>Destroyer cult</em> models weild powerful melee. But what I like most is their reanimation. What they lack in general toughness, they make back by being unkillable. You gun them down, and they get right back up. In the new edition, reanimation protocols get better. Instead of permanently losing material by not being revived immediately, you can generate models back each battleround regardless. </p>
